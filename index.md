# Trip to Thailand!

After many years, I finally had the opportunity to travel to Thailand! Much planning was made with my best friend Selene to do this trip! The places that we visited were Bangkok, Phuket, Krabi, Phi Phi Island, and Chiang Mai!

## The Nature! 
The atmosphere and the local people were absolutely amazing!
We stayed at a Resort right off of the beach! We also got to enjoy our FIRST authentic Thai meal at Annes Thai Food.
