# Trip to Thailand!

After many years, I finally had the opportunity to travel to Thailand! Much planning was made with my best friend Selene to do this trip! The places that we visited were Bangkok, Phuket, Krabi, Phi Phi Island, and Chiang Mai!

## The Nature! 
The atmosphere and the local people were absolutely amazing! This country is [located](https://www.google.co.jp/maps/place/Thailand/@11.2926606,97.4479878,5.45z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x304d8df747424db1:0x9ed72c880757e802!8m2!3d15.870032!4d100.992541 "click here to view the location!") next to Cambodia, Vietnam, and Malaysia! With the rich culture and friendly locals, it was definitely a trip I would never forget.
